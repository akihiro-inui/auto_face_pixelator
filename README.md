# auto_face_pixelator
Facial detection x Pixelator (Mosaic)

# Idea
While I was writting my blog, I realized it was troublesome to pixelate(mosaic) people's faces in my photos.
Why not automate it?

# How it works
Detect face and apply mosaic effect in Realtime & Flask Web App

# Installation
Get Docker of you don't have.
Run "docker-compose up -d"  

# Milestones
1. Locally implement auto face -- done　　
2. Dockernize -- done　　
3. Probably make API -- done　　
4. Moblie app..? -- under consideration
