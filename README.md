# auto_face_pixelator
Facial detection x Pixelator (Mosaic)

# Idea
While I was writting my blog, I realized it was troublesome to pixelate people's faces in my photos.
Why not automate it?

# How it works
Detect face and apply mosaic effect in realtime

# Installation
docker build .  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python face_mosaic_demo.py  

# Steps
1. Locally implement auto face pixelator -- done
2. Dockernize -- done
3. Probably make API -- on the way
4. Mobile app....?
