# auto_face_pixelator
Facial detection x Pixelate

# Idea
While I was writting my blog, I realized it was troublesome to pixelate people's faces on my photos.
Why not automate it?

# Installation
docker build .

# Steps
1. Locally implement auto pixelator -- done
2. Dockernize -- done
2. Probably make API
